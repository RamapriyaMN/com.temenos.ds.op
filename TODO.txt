use juno instead of luna? branch off.. post Q. Kai email?
less configuration/*.log: IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service. Ensure that the org.eclipse.core.runtime bundle is resolved and started (see config.ini).

org.apache.felix.gogo.runtime.CommandNotFoundException: Command not found: gosh 

Waz [The bundles specified in the product definition are ignored; verify the value of the 'type' or 'useFeatures' attribute.] ? Nothing on G.

CloudBees job or Jenkins job.. use offline, do not pull results from previous build

define base.feature & base.sdk.ide.feature feature, list all deps in it, depend on that in product (instead of listing in product)
that will allow other in-house product.feature to depend on it for hiearchy  

learn more from http://git.eclipse.org/c/epp/org.eclipse.epp.packages.git/

add to com.temenos.ds.op.sdk.product:
	egit
	xtext

tests https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Reference_Card#Test_bundles

SDK should have all SRC: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Reference_Card#Source_Bundles

decide about and clear com.temenos.ds.op.base.bundle & com.temenos.ds.op.base.feature (actually not needed, that should be in the refex..)  

move stuff from base/maven/com.temenos.ds.op.base.parent/pom.xml into /pom.xml

group & artificat ID sholdn't be repeated stupidely like that.. shorten them, use something to still produce nice JARs?

aggregate mirros repo in CL.. use https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Additional_Tools#mirror_goal instead b3?

Code Format enforcement
XML Formatting enforcement, how?
FindBugs
Maven rules  enforcement, how? Only modules etc. 

Generate ALL pom.xml, from directory names, via simple Java tool, later packaged as Maven plug-in? A la https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Reference_Card#Generating_POM_files

increase version numbers from 1.0.0 to 10.0.0
mvn set:version ? Tycho has it's own.. document this
